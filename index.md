# HTA CRC Atlas 1

Advanced solid cancers are complex assemblies of tumor, immune, and stromal
cells that invade adjacent tissue and spread to distant sites. Here we use
highly multiplexed tissue imaging, spatial statistics, and machine learning to
identify cell types and states underlying morphological features of known
diagnostic and prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. We find that a
thorough spatial analysis requires imaging the entire tumor region, not small
fields of view (e.g. those found in tissue microarrays). When this condition is
met, the data reveal frequent transitions between histological archetypes (tumor
grades and morphologies) correlated with molecular gradients. At the tumor
invasive margin, where tumor, normal, and immune cells compete, localized
features in 2D such as tumor buds and mucin pools are seen in 3D to be large
connected structures having continuously varying molecular
properties. Immunosuppressive cell-cell interactions also exhibit graded
variation in type and frequency. Thus, whereas scRNA-Seq emphasizes discrete
changes in tumor state, whole-specimen imaging reveals the presence of large-
and small-scale spatial gradients analogous to those in developing tissues.
